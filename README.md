# ðŸ¥£ gravyvalet

`gravyvalet` fetches, serves, and holds small ladlefuls of precious bytes.

together with [waterbutler](https://waterbutler.readthedocs.io)
(which fetches and serves whole streams of bytes, but holds nothing),
gravyvalet provides an api to support "osf addons",
whereby you can share controlled access to online accounts
(e.g. cloud storage) with your collaborators on [osf](https://osf.io).

(NOTE: gravyvalet is still under active development and changes may happen suddenly,
tho current docs may or may not be available at https://addons.staging.osf.io/docs )

# how to...

## ...set up gravyvalet for local development with osf, using docker

0. have [osf running](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf.io/blob/develop/README-docker-compose.md) (with its `api` at `http://192.168.168.167:8000`)
   1. Ensure that `192.168.168.167` is in `ALLOWED_HOSTS` for your local OSF install. (If you have fresh install you can skip this step)
1. Start your PostgreSQL and Django containers with `docker compose up -d`.
2. Enter the Django container: `docker compose exec gravyvalet /bin/bash`.
3. Migrate the existing models: `python manage.py migrate`.
4. Visit [http://0.0.0.0:8004/](http://0.0.0.0:8004/).

## ...run tests

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py test
```
(recommend adding `--failfast` when looking for immediate feedback)

## ...set up external services
Start by launching management command
```bash
python manage.py fill_external_services
```
This should fill all external services which are currently supported by OSF.

They should be visible now in addons list on project and user page. Non-oauth addons should be in working state now, the only thing left is to configure each oauth addon credential
Continue by creating an admin account with
[django's createsuperuser command](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-createsuperuser):

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

then log in with that account at `localhost:8004/admin` to manage
external services (including oauth config) and to create other admin users. 

To configure OAuth addons:
1. Open [admin](http://localhost:8004/admin/addon_service/) 
2. Go to external service you want to configure (it is under **External *\<\<addon type\>\>* service**)
3. After choosing service click on respective OAuth Client config
4. There fill your client id and client secret (instructions to obtain them are [here](./services_setup_doc/README.md))
5. Now you should be able to connect these addons according to existing user flows (in ordinary osf app)

## ...use foreign addons

Foreign addons allow you to extend gravyvalet with additional integrations
without modifying the core code.

To use foreign addons:

1. Install the foreign addon package(s):
```bash
pip install foreign-addon-package-you-want
```

2. Add the foreign addon(s) to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your Django settings:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... existing apps ...
    'foreign_addon_package_you_want.app_name',
    # ...
    'addon_service',
    # ...
]
```

3. Register each foreign addon in `ADDON_APPS` with a unique ID number:
```python
ADDON_APPS = {
    # ... other addons ...
    "YOUR_ADDON_NAME": 5001,  # Use a unique number not used by other addons
}
```

The name of each addon must be documented in the document of the foreign addon
package. If 2 addon applications you want to use adopted identical names, use
the package name instaed:

```python
ADDON_APPS = {
    # ... other addons ...
    'foreign_addon_package_you_want.app_name': 5001,
}
```

The ID numbers must be:
- Unique across all addons
- Never changed once assigned (changing would break existing configurations)

4. Restart gravyvalet to load the new foreign addons

After these steps, the foreign addons will appear alongside built-in addons in
the OSF interface.

## ...configure a good environment
see `app/env.py` for details on all environment variables used.

when run without a `DEBUG` environment variable (note: do NOT run with `DEBUG` in production),
some additional checks are run on the environment:

- `GRAVYVALET_ENCRYPT_SECRET` is required -- ideally chosen by strong randomness,
  with maybe ~128 bits of entropy (e.g. 32 hex digits; 30 d20 rolls; 13 words of a 1000-word vocabulary)

## ...rotate encryption keys responsibly
don't let your secrets get stale! you can rotate the secret used to derive encryption keys
(as well as the parameters for key derivation -- see `app/env.py` for details)

1. update environment:
   - set `GRAVYVALET_ENCRYPT_SECRET` to a new, long, random string (...no commas, tho)
   - add the old secret to `GRAVYVALET_ENCRYPT_SECRET_PRIORS` (comma-separated list)
   - (optional) update key-derivation parameters with best-practices du jour
2. run `python manage.py rotate_encryption` to enqueue key-rotation tasks
   (on the `gravyvalet_tasks.CHILL` queue by default)
3. once that queue of tasks is complete, update environment again to remove the old secret from
   `GRAVYVALET_ENCRYPT_SECRET_PRIORS`

## ...enable pre-commit hooks
Optionally, but recommended: Set up pre-commit hooks that will run formatters and linters on staged files. Install pre-commit using:

```bash

pip install pre-commit
```

Then, run:

```bash

pre-commit install --allow-missing-config
```
